# Overview:-
   1.) Describing the Tips dataset using descriptive statistics and plots
   
   2.) Discussing (Correlation ,Covariance, Skewness,Kurtosis ) and analysing whether there is a relationship between total bill and tip amount
   
   3.) An analysis of the relationship between the variables in the dataset
   
# Summary

      In Part 1 The tips dataset was described using statistics, information  and plots using the pandas and seaborn libraries.
      in part 2 There is a correlation between total bill amount and the tip amount but the plots and statitics show that there are other factors at play
                There is definitely a Linear relationship between the total bill amount and the tip
      in part 3.) more closely at the sex, smoker and size variables in the dataset & predict the tip amount of waiter will get in Restaurant
