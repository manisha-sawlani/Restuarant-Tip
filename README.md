# Restaurant Waiter's Tip

# Context:-

      The Tips dataset is available in the seaborn-data repository belonging to Michael Waskom - the creator of the seaborn python data visualisation package.
     
      also, One waiter recorded information about each tip he received over a period of a few months working in one restaurant. In all he recorded 244 tips.
     
# Overview:-

    1.) Describing the Tips dataset using descriptive statistics and plots
   
    2.) Discussing (Correlation ,Covariance, Skewness,Kurtosis ) and analyzing whether there is a relationship between total bill and tip amount
   
    3.) Prediction of tip using  Linear Regression Analysis.
   
    4.) Visualize relationships between Numerical variables/ Categorical variable with Pairplot. 
   
# Conclusion:-
    
    The main findings of this analysis are:

    1.) Average tip = $2.99, minimum = $1, maximum = $10.
    2.) Average total bill = $19.79, minimum = $3.07, maximum = $50.81.
    3.) 51 of the 244 observations concern non-smokers.
    4.)157 of the 244 observations concern males.
    5.)87 of the 244 observations relate to Saturday.
    6.)176 of the 244 observations relate to dinner.
    7.)The largest group is Male non-smokers in a party of  size 2 (mean = $2.55, count = 57).
    8.)and for the female,The largest group is  non-smokers in a party of  size 2 (mean = $2.37, count = 33).
    9.)The largest group is male non-smokers on Sundays (mean = $3.12, count = 43).
